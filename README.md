# Introduction:

Dengue fever is a serious problem in the Philippines, with a high incidence rate and a significant impact on the population. The country has experienced numerous dengue outbreaks in recent years, causing widespread illness and deaths. In this report, we will use Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to study the trends and patterns of dengue cases in the Philippines. By analyzing the data, we hope to gain a better understanding of the dynamics of dengue fever in the Philippines, identify potential risk factors, and inform public health interventions that can help reduce the incidence of the disease.

# About the Dataset:
